# Code repository for the artefact augmentation from the article 'Improving MR image quality with a multi-task model, using convolutional losses'.

This code augments artefacts to MR images. The four artefact types included in this work are bias fields, k-space subsampling, motion, and noise. This artefact augmentation is used in the article:
